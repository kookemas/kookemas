# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Anton Kashin
Iâ€™m currently learning embedded programming with C/C++ and building small robotics projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
My interests include real-time control, motor drivers, and integrating simple sensors for automation.
Iâ€™ve built a basic line-following robot, experimented with PID loops, and started exploring ROS (Robot Operating System).

Long-term goal: contribute to open-source robotics projects and build smarter autonomous machines.
